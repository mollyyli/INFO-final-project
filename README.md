## University District Crime Data

### [**Link to the app**](https://thebriando.shinyapps.io/INFO-final-project/)

This data originates from the Seattle Police Department which we accessed via API. This dataset contains all of the reported incidents in the greater Seattle area from 2008-2017. We narrowed down the dataset for this application to just the reports within the University District. The details contained within this data include:

* Report Number
* Date Occurred & Date Reported
* Time Occurred & Time Reported
* Crime Subcategory: type of crime
* Sector: area of occurrence
* Primary Offense Description: brief description of offense

This app was created for UW students and faculty in order for them to be more aware and informed of the dangers in the area. Using this app, users can learn...

* what area is safest to live in.
* what crimes occur the most often.
* when those crimes are most likely to occur (based on month and time of day)

Ultimately, this app will provide information that UW students and faculty can use to plan ahead and live safer lifestyles.
